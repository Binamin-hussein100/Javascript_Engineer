// Strings
// Anything that is enclosed within quotation marks
// Either single quotes, double quotes or backticks. 
// Whenever you see a \ inside a quoted texts, this indicates that the character after it has a special meaning.
"There are, of course, situations where you want a backslash in a string to \
be just a backslash, not a special code."

// Strings can be concatinated
console.log("binamin" + " " + "Hussein") // binamin Hussein
