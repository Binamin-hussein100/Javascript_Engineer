# JAVASCRIPT

## JS values.

Javascript values are of four types. 
    -numbers
    -strings
    -Booleans 
    -undefined values

Such values are created by typing in their names (true, null) or their value(13,'abc')

You can combine and transform values with operators
eg: 
    -Binary operators for arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/ and %) plus string concatenation
    -Comparison operators (>,<,>=,<=,==,===,!=,!==)
    -Logical operators (&&, ||)
    -Unary operators (- to negate a number, ! to negate a logic, typeof to find the values type, ternary operator ?: to pick one of 2 values based on the 3rd value (whether its true or false))
